# Mini Wallet API

This web API demonstrates how core PHP can be applied in REST API development. 
The application uses a custom-built framework to manage API requests. 
It runs on an Nginx server, and data storage is handled using JSON files in the filesystem.



# Http namespace

The Http namespace provides classes and interfaces that handle HTTP requests. 
The HttpMethod class handles HTTP GET and POST requests. 
The IController interface is used to create controllers for routes. 
The class Middleware is an abstract class with a template method. 
The HTTP namespace uses the HttpRequest and MiddlewareResponse enums for type safety.
